This respository contains the supporting script for my Imperial College London MSc Conservation Science thesis entitled 'Drivers of Conservation Initiatives: Locally Managed Marine Areas in Fiji'

The analysis involved using a Bayesian hierachical logistic regression model to identify contextual factors that led to the  
rapid adoption of community-led marine protected areas in Fiji. 

The main package used to carry out the analysis was R-INLA (Rue et al., 2009)

grated nested Laplace approximations (with discussion). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B,
